In this task, I learned the basic concepts of computer networking and their importance in cyber security. By using Wireshark, I captured and analyzed live network traffic and understood how data is transmitted over a network. I observed TCP, DNS, and HTTP packets, studied the TCP three-way handshake, and learned the difference between encrypted and unencrypted traffic. This task improved my understanding of network communication and helped me develop practical skills in network traffic analysis, which are essential for cyber security.
